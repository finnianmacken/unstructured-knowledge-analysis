- What if search didn’t stop at keywords? Abstract poetry reinvents search to eliminate exhausting keyword engineering, and systemic bias towards popular results by listening to your preferences and returning results based on paper content not just keywords.

Summary of proposal - 

We used systems thinking, user focused design, and interdisciplinary development to redesign academic search so it facilitates exploratory and exhaustive search without keyword engineering. We brought our product to beta testing from an idea in 2 months, but are limited by the costs of hosting and gaining access to academic data making our product easily scalable with relatively low investment.",2022-08-22 21:43:56.628000+00:00,EllieDeSota,

"> Or in a less - grr bad scientist - way you've done the research and if you had found the similar things you wouldn't have done it. 

I have literally no idea what this means lol xD. Please rephrase. 

> how are you calculating distance? (and is it based on semantic spaces bc If so then isn't the semantic embeddings inherently going to be better bc that's what you're comparing against? Not sure on this tho)

Distance is Euclidean, which is the intuitive, ""how far apart are these two points"" measure. I didn't want to measure cosine because it can be more compressive because the domain is [-1, 1]. 
You calculate distances between vectors, so it's necessarily with embedding vectors and therefore semantic spaces. I don't know what you mean by ""inherently going to be better"".",2022-08-19 23:04:17.526000+00:00,andrepology,
"> is it bc citations are inherently biases towards showing stuff that actually isn't that similar to your own work? (otherwise you can't justify it). 

Going to give this reexplanation my best shot. This was an experiment to test the hypothesis that ""Cited papers are closer in meaning to nearest neighbours"", and we use embeddings to capture meaning and Euclidean distance to measure closeness. 

This is confirmed, in a sense, if cited papers are much closer (the blue distribution is narrower and closer to the left) to the source paper and closer on average to nearest neighbours, especially since our database is so sparse: I thought we'd find that the nearest neighbors in our database are realllly far apart. 

This is falsified, however, with this result: citations are in fact further and more dispersed than nearest neighbours in our tiny database.  

What this tells us (in as many versions as I can think of): 
+ recommendation systems that use the citation graph to find similar papers are flawed, and skip a lot of papers close in meaning we would find otherwise with semantic spaces. 
+ semantic spaces are a superset of the citation graph
+ it takes much longer walks through citation graphs to find papers close in meaning

^ The last thing might be worthwhile testing. How many networks of networks do you have to traverse to get to the closest paper in meaning that you would otherwise find with a simple nearest neighbor operation with semantic spaces?",2022-08-19 23:03:59.791000+00:00,andrepology,

I was testing separation implicitly through the number of replicated papers when calling nearest neighbors of references,2022-08-19 21:27:58.997000+00:00,finn,
"This is what the experiment is: 
1. Take a source paper
2. Retrieve its n local citation graph (the papers it cites, the papers that cite it) as embeddings (Blue)
3. Retrieve its n local neighbours in our tiny semantic space (Orange)
4. Calculate the distances between the source papers and its citation-linked papers and neighburs
5. Plot the histograms on same axis

This is a really striking result for two reasons. 

First,  and most important, even in our terribly small database, the nearest neighbours are closer in meaning (mean ~60) than the citation-linked papers (mean ~85, see plot above). As such, this is what confirms the hypothesis that semantic spaces de-bias or enrich or trouce the citation graph: you get much better results that paper-trails just by looking at things closeby in meaning. This is a quantitative reconfirmation of stuff we've seen with user tests // another way of making sense of why it works. The overlap of nearest neighbors and citation graph is also quite small, though this will improve as the database gets richer. 

Second, the wide spread in citation-linked papers (which I think you stumbled upon and called ""separation"" <@752493639174717492> though the experiments weren't well documented) might situate a paper in different contexts. ie you cite something that may not be related directly but could be ""seminal"" ie the ""tipping my hat"" cronyism citations inherent in citation graphs.",2022-08-19 21:26:18.123000+00:00,andrepology,

My team and I are looking to build tools for researchers in industry as well as academia, but most of our network comprises of scientists that don’t have much insight into the workflows of big tech and the problems faced by researchers like you. 

Would you have twenty to thirty minutes to spare at any point to answer some questions about research in industry? Specifically, some of my questions are:
    •    What does a research workflow look like in industry, and how might it differ from research in academia?
    •    What are the biggest issues with your research workflows right now? What tools and would be most helpful to have?
    •    How does academic research tie into the rest of the work that companies like Google do?

"Overall,

I'm content. 

I think that it takes some perspective and agreeing that we *did* go in wanting to ""capture imagination"", which auspiciously or inauspiciously means not having a full-blown or fundable or revenue-generating project.

That said, I agree with Ellie in that the critical thing we're missing is not a quorum of user interviews or a user driven framework, but a follow through on translating those insights to product decisions. Unlike civicdash, I felt like I shouldered a lot of the product thinking, which was fraught with bias here because, as you rightly said earlier <@752493639174717492>, I was in love with the idea of generous interface and a new technology that enabled human in the loop. That said, I think in hindsight I wish we collaborated on the design thinking more like we did with civicdash, where I open the diamond and you closed or vice versa. It may or may not have advanced the demo to a product (again, we did go this in a very short amount of time), but I think it goes to show that we did not have a spec that the three of us wrote and agreed on together outlining the concept and vision: what Ellie sent to the Minerva alum was a riff of what I wrote over that weekend in turkey. 

I don't regret it at all. I'm very proud to show it to others, but I think the next time round, whether it's abstract Poetry v2 or something new, I think my biggest learning is to make sure we're as synced on the concept and product as we are on the development.

"TLDR - It seems like we want to work together and staking our working together on getting funding for a startup (a notoriously unlikely thing) seems like a bad idea. So yes let's jump ship if that gives us better chances of doing that, but also our failure case for working together should not be 'we don't get funding'. There are many ways to get money and continue to work together without be recognized for our briliant startup idea that we patched together in 4 months while traveling/doing school/ and having social lives (maybe).

Ye - I don't think this needs to be the original implementation. (And potentially it's completely ignored in this email) But it seems like the next step - and it's the most connection that we would have to Discourse Graphs which is Protocol Lab's shit. My current random thoughts on this - I think we could be the search for discourse graphs by training a semantic algorithm that takes in all the 'citations' of the claim node to understand the actual claim bc otherwise I see their whole idea of searching the graph to be nearly freaky and untenable (But that's mainly bc claims are essentially a sentance long -> and I haven't thought about this THAT much) (side note done - feel free to ignore),2022-08-17 01:54:51.996000+00:00,EllieDeSota,<MessageReference message_id=1009278715592708138 channel_id=1002291205025050724 guild_id=977651180308160512>

Yo - been a bit out of it today. But filling in in on some details - there are several factors to consider relating to Protocol Labs. The people they currently fund/the things they're currently involved in is explicitly Web3 technologies + ways of improving the 'network' or decentralization of the web x academia. If you go on their site - they have a huge amount of mainly academic Web3 research papers cited and we would be applying as researchers (we need a formal PI -> likely Watson and we would be student researchers). That being said there is a bunch of product stuff and the main project that Protocol is currently focusing on is called Discourse Graphs and it's a product that is integrated with Roam Research to improve researcher work flows + create a way of linking evidence to claims.,2022-08-17 01:38:47.191000+00:00,EllieDeSota,

My general feeling atm is potentially more aligned with what we said in our meeting earlier -> we need to back up a bit and figure stuff out for where this goes and how it works better/fits in a workflow/can be improved. I think the bibliography stuff is a step in the right direction, and I'm perfectly content to spend our first two months even of the school year just researching, talking to people, and finding our target audience through content creation and a solid strategy. While it does feel like a 'stop' of momentum on the development side, potentially spending time with design changes isn't a great use of time bc we need to figure how to transform AP into something that can feed us. (As a note - I'm noticing I see the next year as 8 months to let ourselves expand, not as panic worthy constraint and am generally actively trying to push in the direction of lack of panic bc I think it can lead to lots of funky decisions.

"Worth acknowledging that a lot of this is driven by anxiety about what I'm going to do after college.

I think we need to have that type of urgency to be successful, because with the current plan for Abstract Poetry, it seems like we're going to have to code and market a completely new startup in between now and the end of Minerva, which is a crazy amount of work alongside friends and other projects/jobs and capstone",2022-08-16 03:47:10.106000+00:00,finn,

We're very rapidly running out of time to build something that earns us enough money to work together out of college, and this is one of our last chances.

Because that's my mindset, I'm desperately trying to improve the application as much as possible before going on break. Some of the issues that I have with AP are the design, and normally i'd be fine leaving that to you, but to be honest <@956585029524402226> you don't seem to be really working on Abstract Poetry right now, so rather than waiting hours or days for you to respond, I'm implementing design changes myself because we don't have that time to waste.

i can change the proportion of abstract to cluster viewer to emphasise it more,2022-08-15 04:50:16.883000+00:00,finn,
Things that are fun - it prioritizes the cluster view. Things that are weird it squishes the abstract view so you have the bad vibes of moving your eyes down a page slightly too rapidly. (I do it on the phone all the time but dislike on a computer screen) so might need t o figure out the control panel,2022-08-15 04:46:35.027000+00:00,EllieDeSota,
Yes - agree. Andre and I were chatting about something similar. Lots of things need refactoring in this set up and I think we may want to go even further and have a really easy way to just navigate the cluster view and then have the abstract act as a pop up when you want more info. But yah - I additionally seems to give more room to the abstract for reading.

We should chat about how this fits with each of our capstones + AP + Skepsi and how it can connect with our potential go to market strategy. (Or alternatively -> that it's not where we want to be). (Side note - there is a small chance DeSci labs may be able to fund me for this (low 4 figures).

"TLDR from chatting with Sophia yesterday. We've got too many go to market strategies and we should probably get serious about choosing who we want to use as our Target user to intelligently choose between them. The best way to do this on her end was clarifying our goals for the upcoming 4 months so we can prioritize the channels we're split over. (Some of this was I communicated poorly/some of it is something we should do). We ~may~ need to create an LLC or use Andre's shell company? before attempting to monetize anything. But her take (which seems in line with where we're going) is that we likely shouldn't focus on monetizing in the next sprint, and instead should focus on getting monthly active users. My first thoughts are here -> and I'll make this clearer using our previous retrospective but we may need to have a chat on Monday to make this super clear across all of us.",2022-08-12 19:43:08.276000+00:00,EllieDeSota,
