"a couple feature requests:

- it would be fantastic if whiteboards could be collapsed / folded to show only their title, the same way cards can!

- it would be nice to be able to set the size of a collapsed card's title.
-- often I only want the title of a card showing, but for readability I wish I could set the text size to H1 or H2 size, for example. the collapsed card's text is very small for me currently. I get around this by using the card unfolded and resizing the card to hide the rest of the text, but I have to add a block with a period to get an even margin of whitespace around the title (see screenshot - on the 3rd card, the first line of body text is visible and distracting, compared to the other two where I ""fake"" a full margin and all attention goes to the title).",2022-09-13 01:48:41.251000+00:00,robotic_scarab,,[],[],1019062030176616458,[<Attachment id=1019062029572649100 filename='ss_20220912_204422.png' url='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856016076311101470/1019062029572649100/ss_20220912_204422.png'>]

"Hi, wanted to share an opinion and ask about the ""visuality options"" of Hepta.

We currently have:
- Actual text inside cards (with integrated interoperability, backlinks…)
- Cards (which are visual containers of the interoperable text, with some meta-info)
- Arrows (mere visual artifacts, they have no connection with the interop. text)

I wanted to share a tool called Mural (https://mural.co/), **focusing on what it offers as visual aspects**. Maybe the dev team already knows about it, or maybe not.


What would be nice to have in Hepta is *more options for visual variety*.

Examples:
- Possibility to add **Pure Images**
- Possibility to give **Different Skins** to the card
- Possibility for more **Text Formatting**

Just thinking about it, a different ""Skin"" for a card could be: pure image. So, if the dev teams for some reason don't think it's the best to add pure images, we could have a Card but *skinned* as pure image. You click on it and it opens the fully detailed card as it happens now. One can decide to only have image(s) in it (and choose which one is to be the cover) and let it view as pure image on the board, or choose to see it as normal card. A card could be added multiple times on a WB, but with different skins.

Another Skin could be: *Sticky Note*, very commonly used by many people. Still a full card when you click on it, but visually a sticky note on the WB.

Another useful visual possibility would be to be able to add *plain text on the whiteboard*, not inside a card.

We could also have a **Pure Text** Skin for a card (or maybe not, that's the devs' decision) and have the possibility to format it, examples: greater font size, different text color, whatever.

With just these 2 additions (**Pure Images**, and **Pure Text**), we would have a much greater series of options to visually customize our whiteboards, which can be really important for easiness of managing them, easiness of recalling information, and just more visual appeal of the WBs.",2022-09-04 17:07:43.799000+00:00,jagar,,[],[],1016031823995883641,[]

"Suggestions

1. Calendar System
Thank you all for all the hardwork, I would also like to request. As my job requires me to work with dates a lot. If it will be possible, not only to have access to only the current date but to be able to choose from previous dates and future dates, because some situations require you to use dates that is not necessarily today. I think some sort of built in calendar system to view your work by calendar when you mark the date (Not the Journal feature, but in the whiteboard and card sessions too) similar to remnote 

2. To Dos
For ToDos, if we can mark due date, time, reminders etc can be helpful

3. Interface
I do like the interface of arranging by whiteboards, but overtime, it can look a bit displeasing to the eyes, so if there is a way to maybe beautify the interfaces a little more? especially the map session, maybe with images or gallery view / other views etc

4. Being able to pin important notes on the working tabs session
If we can pin the important notes, and whiteboards, that will be game changing.

5. Highlights
If we can be able to change the different highlight colors.

Thank you so much for all the hardwork, Heptabase, is truly the future. <@779015270311395370>",2022-09-03 14:49:27.860000+00:00,Richy,,[],[<User id=779015270311395370 name='Alan Chan' discriminator='3179' bot=False>],1015634640440152085,[]

While a database management system offers reduced redundancy, reduced inconsistency, and improved query processing, it is much costlier than a file system. Also, it is much more complex.

"Hi Heptabase team, 

你好，我是一位在科技業從事十年左右的工程師，平時熱愛嘗試新鮮事物
很感謝你們製作了這麼棒的工具，
付費使用幾天後有一些我覺得可以改善的地方 
說是改善或許有點驕縱了，

有可能是我使用方式不對，
抑或是開發團隊在這項功能的定義或思維有獨到的見解  (如果觀點很好我也可以改變使用習慣)

如果有任何認知或使用方法有誤請幫忙指證，謝謝

- **沒有 unlinked reference 功能**
1. 輸入的流暢度：例如一段話裡面可能有數個重要的詞，還是得製成卡片或連結到卡片，不然以後無法找到，那麼完成這段輸入的效率就會打折扣

2. 隨手打在 Journal 筆記或靈感，如果沒有把其中一個 term 製成卡片 or tag， 若沒有unlinked reference, 時日一長就大海撈針，這個可能可以透過每日勤加整理的使用習慣，但還是希望有此功能

3. 以上兩點雖然可以透過基本的搜尋功能找到卡片，不過右邊的預覽圖只會顯示卡片的整體，並沒法標示出出現在卡片的哪個地方

4. 大概想的到會增加複雜度，例如顯示頁面時讀取時間會比較久一點

5. 可能會讓頁面看起來雜亂，不過 Logseq 的處理方式我覺得還不錯，預設是收起來的 (摺疊)

~~**- to-do 沒有搜尋功能; 開發中**~~

**- Hypothesis 下載功能**

**- Readwise 整合**

**- Tag = page, 換到 Hepta  = card,  Logseq 的好用功能**

**- ~~ 無法自定義 Metadata 模板, 可能就得自己複製

Template is on the roadmap. Stay tuned!~~**

If not, could you please describe how it is going to work?



Also, on another note, do you have plans to implement ways to allow users to use a ""more diverse range of text formatting""?
Examples
Sometimes, you'd like to use just a brief title for a card perhaps linked with some other cards around it or not.
But this card with the brief title, you somehow want it to stand out a bit more with respect of other cards nearby.
In that case it'd would be useful to for instance, having the possibility for the text size to 'follow' the card size. Just like images, the text could increase itsefl when we increase the card.
Not to be applied for every text of course. Just some.

Or another example: having the possibility to change the font of some text. Or even color?

The main idea is that: we are plotting cards over a 2d physical space (whiteboard), so that our visual processing mental area could be ""better stimulated"".
Instead of having a boring 'text wall' (even if it can be outlined as in Obsidian or Logseq), the whiteboard should give better mind stimulation.

So having another dimension for changes, like being able to differentiate the text inside cards should increase the stimulation.

Because now, when we write a lot of cards inside a whiteboard, we can only play with the card color and card size, but many cards will still look quite similar if we don't need to change color that much. For instance because the info collected are similar in category.
Having bigger texts will also allow for faster reading on scaled out wb.",2022-08-19 06:28:28.090000+00:00,jagar,,[],[<User id=779015270311395370 name='Alan Chan' discriminator='3179' bot=False>],1010072742642581524,[]

"I know this flow gives way more speed because there is a tiny Mac app called ""BetterSnapTool"" that I immediately install in every new Mac installation because it's just so useful.

It allows to move (and also resize) any window of the applications in the way described.

No need to position the cursor over the top bar of the app and press down the left button to move a window. Just have the cursor over any part of the window, press the keyboard buttons, and then just move the cursor.
It is just so quick.

That app also allows to resize any windown, without having to go with the cursor directly at the border of the window, just place the cursor over any part of a window, press down the keyboard buttons, and move the cursor (not need to press down the left button of the mouse).

"Regarding order and tidiness of the cards inside a whiteboard:

I think it is safe to say that the main focus of using Hepta is about inputting/collecting content, and/or creating new content based on the thinking/analysis done on the collected content.

A subsidiary/ancillary set of operations to support the main focus is about placing and moving the cards inside a whiteboard to allow an overall better understanding of the content.

A quality-of-life aspect then could be the *speed*, and in parallel the *friction*, that is intrinsically exhibited by the current flow.
The less friction, the greater speed.

On the placement and moving of cards, I know it is already planned to improve the alignment and snapping of cards, on the roadm ap: ""Whiteboard: Alignment guidelines & better snapping"".


What I'd like to ask is about a significant decrease of friction in moving the cards.
The current way of moving cards is:
- The cursor needs to be positioned at the top bar of a card when it's unfolded (or inside the folded card area)
- press down the left button of the mouse (or trackpad)
- move the mouse (or finger over the trackpad), *while* the finger pressed down
- release the finger when the card is positioned where it's needed


The proposal is about the following:
- having a hotkey to be pressed on the keyboard, example: CMD+ALT (just these two)
- a this point, the user can position the cursor over *any point of the entire area* of a card, not just the top bar when it's unfolded
- press down the hotkeys, in this example the two keyboard buttons CMD+ALT
- no need to press down the left button of the mouse (or trackpad)
- just freely move the mouse (or finger over the trackpad)
- when card is positioned where it's needed, just release the two keyboard buttons


The increment of speed is given by:
- freedom to position the cursor over the entire area of the card
- not having to continuously press down the left button of the mouse",2022-08-12 12:44:34.687000+00:00,jagar,,[],[],1007630678751465482,[]
"Hello, 

At this link of Hepta Use Cases: https://heptaplatforms.notion.site/Use-Case-How-people-are-using-Heptabase-70c85a0c686945218427618549087629
Section: ""Keep track on what I know and what I don't know""

There is screenshot of a whiteboard. It shows a way of using cards a BIG TITLES on top of other cards, which is nice.

One thing that is marginally related to these kind of cards, meaning it could be applied to other kind of cards/blocks:

- Possibility to Align the Text in a block:
     - **Align to Right**
     - **Align to Left**
     - **Center**
    - Possibly Justify as well maybe, but not sure if it could be needed


Having the possibility to center the text will give a more pleasant presentation of the TITLE Cards at the top.

The current only way of placing the Text at the center is to manually add several blank spaces before the text. We know it's not an optimal way though (it is tiresome and if the card width changes, the text is not centered anymore for example).

Just to avoid misunderstandings, I'm talking about the horizontal centering of a text.
I may imagine that centering the text vertically as well may not be possible perhaps, because of how the blocks are structured inside a card.",2022-08-12 10:00:02.941000+00:00,jagar,,[<discord.embeds.Embed object at 0x28f95c160>],[],1007589273647714314,[]

"Is it possible to have Heptabase work with Hook? For the record, hook is an amazing application that provides system wide linking/backlinking features. 

Basically, if I'm navigating a page in safari or even a file in finder, I can copy the link to that resource. I can then create an apple note or in any other note taking app and link this note to the link created by hook (for a webpage it'll be the url, for a file it'll be a file://, for other apps, like omnifocus, it will be omnifocus://xxxx). Then whenever I open this same url or focus on the file in finder, I can invoke hook and it'll allow me to jump to the note I've created. Similarly, if I open the note, I can invoke hook and it'll jump to the url or file in finder (or any other resource).

It's possible to have hook integrate with Hepta provided hepta is able to provide references to its notes.

It's also possible to integrate more by providing an API to directly create a note from hook, the use case being: I have my focus on a given pdf file in my finder, I invoke hook and I would be able to trigger, ""create new note in hepta"", it will create a new note, paste a link to this pdf in the note and link the two at hook level.

It may seem a bit abstract, it was not clear to me how it was working at the beginning, but after using it for a while it proves to be super useful. As an example of nice integration, craft and obsidian are integrated with the tool. It would be nice to have a similar integration with Hepta.

To have it work with Hepta, there are a few requirements that are explained on Hook page:

On a Whiteboard, after opening the Card Library on the right sidebar to import them.

Sometimes you are not 100% sure which card needs to be imported because there could be a few similar cards that perhaps have small differences just in the content, or the tags, or in which whiteboards they are in.

Or perhaps, before importing them, you would just like to see their info for any reason.

Feature Request: Be able to see the Card Info **before** importing them, right from the Card Library list of cards.
Something like: double click on a card in the Card Library, and its details are opened at the center of the screen, similarly to how they get opened when you click on a card in the Card Library opened *from the left sidebar*.

It would kinda also be more of a ""consistent"" behavior because we have the same feature ""Card Library"" openable from the Right sidebar, and also openable from the left sidebar. 
But the one openable from the right sidebar does not give the possibility to show the card info when clicking (or double clicking, or whatever other trigger you think of) on it.

Even though the two Card Library are essentially the same as they both list all the cards, and they both have the same ways to filter them at the top (All Cards, Uncategorized, Filter Tags, Filter Whiteboards, Custom Filters). So it would be more consistent to be able to see the card info from the Card Library opened from the Right sidebar.",2022-08-03 07:14:08.956000+00:00,jagar,,[],[],1004286032818221177,[]

"Hi, regarding searching of a card, especially after typing @ inside another card

Let's make an example: searching for the card titled:
- ""Who are your competitors?""

Currently, to retreive the card we want, if we start from the first word (which is the most common case I believe), we *have to* write the complete word before typing the next one. 
So, currently, we need to type: ""who are""

Instead, the search could be faster if we can just type some of the letters that are in the title, example: ""wh com""


Another example: we have cards for a book of 20 chapters. There are 20 cards one for each chapter. They all start with the word ""Chapter"" followed by the number: ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"", ... and so on.

Currentl, if we want to link a chapter cards into another card, we have to write the full word ""chapter"" before specifying the number.
It would be easier and much quicker if we can just type ""cha 1"" or ""ch 1"" (instead of ""chapter 1"") and the card titled ""Chapter 1"" appears in the search result.


I know there is a name for this kind of search, but I don't remember it.
Hope the examples are clear enough.

Is there a chance it will be added to the roadmap later on?

"<@779015270311395370> I played around in the app and apparently there are two different behaviors for ""Entering"" a whiteboard.

Firstly, when you keep the pointer over a whiteboard, a small popup appears at the top of the whiteboard card with the text:
""Double Click to enter
Drag to move""

At the moment there are 3 different ways to 'enter' a whiteboad:
1. Double click on it
2. Clicking the small icon at the top right of the whiteboard (a small image of a rectangle with an arrow pointing up)
3. Right-click on the whiteboard, a popup with some options will appear, select ""Enter"" from it

From a user experience point of view, it is perhaps expected that all the 3 option will have the same exact effect (because it is always just used the word ""Enter""), but, at least in this last version 0.179.0, that's not the case.

What happens regarding the Whiteboard shown in the Working Tabs list is the following:
- By using option 1 and 2 the current Whiteboard that is already shown in the working tab is *replaced* by the one we are entering;
- But, by using option 3 (with the right-click), the currently open whiteboard remains in the Working Tabs list, and the one we are opening is immediately added below the previous one.


Is this a bug or an expected behavior?

"just to be sure about something

at the moment, if there are for example 3 nested whiteboards:
- Top
-- Middle
--- Bottom

If we open the whiteboard Top
it shows in the Working Tabs list automatically

The whiteboard Top has some cards in it + the whiteboard Middle

after opening Top, if we double click on the Middle whiteboard it will be opened

and automatically it shows in the working tabs
BUT
it kinda overrides the already opened Top wb

the same happens it we then open the Bottom wb: Middle gets removed from the working tabs, and Bottom is shown.

- a card contains a link
- user clicks the link
- a small in-app window opens the web page of the link
- so the user doesn't have to leave Hepta

- being able to create a new type of card that is a in-app browser
- this type of card always shows the web page of the inserted link
- it can be navigated as a normal web browser

In that case the whiteboard could contain multiple web-browser cards in it

"Request:
A better hotkey mechanism for ""Alt + ← / →""
-
First, I love this hotkey:
Alt + ← / → (Win) to go to previous/next place.
With only one exception:
-
When I open a card in a Card Library or search by Ctrl+O or Ctrl+P, the card was ""zoom-to-center"" view mode as attached image.
Under this scenario, my intention is to view card by card (clicking internal link) to find the most appropriate one to use. 
But there is no ""backward/forward"" hotkey during the ""zoom-to-center"" view mode. (or there is?)
I find it's hard to keep the streamline of thoughts if I can't move fast during the browsing.
-
My suggestion:
Make Alt + ← / → (Win) to perform ""backward/forward"" in ""zoom-to-center"" view mode.
(Add a left/right arrow to top-left would be even better.)
-
Reason:
Since ""zoom-to-center"" view mode already BLOCKED most of the view,
there's no point to switch back and forth between Journal / Whiteboard / Map / Card Library / Tags during ""zoom-to-center"" view mode.
Under this scenario, Alt + ← / → (Win) would be a better replacement to perform ""backward/forward"" in ""zoom-to-center"" view mode.
It's intuitive enough since you know what you're focusing on your screen, and we don't need to remember another hotkey.",2022-07-25 03:45:23.203000+00:00,瓦基,,[],[],1000972005211902102,"[<Attachment id=1000972003307687936 filename='unknown.png' url='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856016076311101470/1000972003307687936/unknown.png'>, <Attachment id=1000972003685187624 filename='unknown.png' url='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856016076311101470/1000972003685187624/unknown.png'>]"

"hi, been playing with the app
so far so good
the hierarchy seems to be:
Map
Whiteboards
Cards
Blocks


and those are also strict logical levels as well

wondering if something like this could be done (or you've already planned it):
in a whiteboard, there could be hundreds of cards
with arrows around

sometimes, it could be useful to have the possibility to just visually group some related cards
I know that you could group them in a new whiteboard, but they won't show up in the currect whiteboard anymore, and the links may also not been shown

I'm wondering just about a visual rectangle that encloses some cards
something like the representation of a package in a UML diagram

"v0.172.1
Performance request:
-
(1) When typing in the card title section, there's an obvious delay-time about 0.5~1 second
I guess Heptabase judge every title input at first, then display text later.
This mechanism, maybe, was designed to sync same title name is different cards with the same title.
My suggestion:
When typing in the title, display at first, then judge every input later in the background.
The syncing of the card title is NOT a time-critical task, but the delay of the display really drags user experience.
-
(2) When there is an internal link card name existed inside a same note, the link name is NOT synced.
In this case, the internal link of 「個體稀缺」 sits inside the same card, the naming is not synced.
Request scenario:
I often finish a NEW content while typing in an old card.
Next, I create a NEW card with a keyword or sentence, then copy the entire NEW content to the NEW card.
I don't want to manually remove the internal link in the NEW card, I also think there's no need for doing so.
Later, when I change the card title, I'd like to see the internal link name was synced as well.
The above scenario was performed in all Whiteboard, Tab, Journal.

"v0.170.0
A Drag-and-Drop Optimisation Request:
---
When I want to move single/multiple card(s) across a whiteboard, the experience is not smooth.
As shown, 
1) I selected 3 cards
2) move them for a distance
3) I ""right-click"" on the whiteboard to move further ( because I want to move cards far away, keeping their original layout )
4) Then, the SELECTION of cards was removed.
5) I have to select them again, and repeat step 1) ~ 3)
---
- The steps above requires multiple ""precise"" selections
- The larger the whiteboard, more painful the experience
- The more complex of the layout of the cards, more painful the experience
- The pain increases with the increasing size of whiteboard 
p.s. I'm not a fan of multi-layer whiteboard (I only use multi-layer whiteboard under few conditions), I prefer to browse notes in a big glance, then Drag-and-Drop and create connection

"I've been enjoying breaking down the findings and arguments of research papers in Heptabase into Cards. The bottleneck for me now is taking screenshots (of PDF files) and creating Cards, and I wonder if we can make it easier while we are thinking Better Exploring. My current workflow is roughly like this:
1. Open Heptabase and a PDF reader side by side
2. Take screenshots of a part of paper I want
3. Click on a whiteboard to create a card
4. Paste the screenshot into the card
5. Write notes on the Card and make connections
6. Repeat 2-5 many many times depending on the complexity of the paper

Can we make this flow more smooth? For example, can we combine Steps 1 2 3 4 by opening a PDF file in Heptabase and I can select part of PDF file and drag it to the whiteboard to create a card (and no more manual screenshots)?",2022-07-11 14:59:46.351000+00:00,cyb3rm4x,,[],[],996068289837027368,[]

My usage scenario is writing fiction in Heptabase (or at least I want it to be because now Heptabase lacks necessary functionality). A card would be a scene or a beat. I could tag the cards with something like #manuscript so that I would be able to filter those later for export. Even better would be to have them sorted automatically, from left to right first, then from the top down. Let's assume I have cards organized in columns as chapters and rows as scenes.
The best way would be to be able to group cards into larger units and order the groups as I wish 😁.

"I understand overlaps of functions and uses can make it trickier for some users on 'how to use' or 'how to organize' - but said overlap is inevitable in flexible apps, and by the variety of personas and usecases interested in hepta (and each one with their preferences) i think the flexibility should stay

for example do we put everything in 1 board, less boards, or many boards? nested boards or not? tags or boards?
when apps kill any and all redudancies they make it easier to get into but reduce extremely who will want to use then. Logseq have 1 way of doing things and i struggled with it. Obsidian i struggled with. Mem kills any and all choice from the user and despite some useful features i couldnt make it work for me... the list goes on

Freedom and overlaps have a cost- like people unsure how to layout things... thats the reason why notions reddit is full of tips and templates sharing, and tons of videos on youtube...

but the thing is that freedom is what made notion such a popular hit in the first place. Evernote is similar and been around for decades and didnt grow like notion did ever. Google keep been around for longer but theres no passion nor growth for it... obsidian pales in comparison to notion but its the most popular zettel focused app out there amongst dozens (theres a lot of alternatives, i test all of then), also full of community sharing and its a MESS in terms of how complex things can get with plugins

Everyone wants the tool that catters best to then but everyone is different. The secret formula (and tricky part) is how to make such flexible freedom 'make your it your own' as simple to get and use as possible. Notion did it pretty well as far as its possible and id say hepta been doing it pretty damn well too",2022-06-28 12:46:26.702000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],991323694624424006,[]
"but id argue that 'habit' of some users and designers/teams is avoidable by design- like an app with both features that dont mix then like logseq does.
Theres no graph in hepta right now but there was and i think the feature will come back- the graph is a great way for users to clearly see the difference. The app and tutorials could mention and show examples of how to use things but even without doing it users would find out naturally ('oh i can filter by tags, not mentions' 'hm mentions show links in the graph and backlinks')

but definetly better comunicating that would be better.
Showing tags as pills on the card would do well...

I also think a requested feature would really help here- showing tags on cards, like appearing on hover or always being show
I think that alone would clear any confusions- the tags would be really tagging the cards with labels, while mentions would appear as non intrusive hyperlinks in text like were all used to, since its the same as hyperlinks on the web

Most users wouldnt even need to know or use inline tags- more like a surprise 'oh i can also link to a tag!'- and by then appearing different (like the pill they already see on cards) it would make sense",2022-06-28 12:38:15.538000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],991321634533281942,[]
i believe the confusion comes because of many apps and users where the misuse of each happens; like apps that only have tags or only have mentions have users using 1 single feature for both usecases,2022-06-28 12:30:32.368000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],991319691857494106,[]
"i understand the questions. Logseq for example gave up on the debate and uses tags=mentions (it really only changes the display and input, but in logseq theyre the same thing)

Thing is tags and mentions already have a difference in Hepta- we can filter all cards by tag, not by mention; Cards show every mention to then as backlinks, not every card that uses the same tag as then in backlinks

The very concept of both are different from the start- tags is typology, classification. From the time before computers to this day theyre meant to say 'this is type x, that type y' - groups that can overlap but the itens in each group arent necessarily related to each other

Mentions on the other hand come from zettelkasten (also before computers), and also from hyperlinks (early internet) with the same concept- indicating A is related to B directly, not as 'same type'

In a graph for example (like obsidians, and heptas early graph feature) it would make sense for cards of a company, a product and a project showing a connection between then (say its a product from said company and its related to a particular project)
-that would be mentions, direct links... between things that arent the same type (a company, a product, a project, different types)

But the same graph shouldnt link for example that product with another product just because theyre both products. Imagine in the example theres other companies and products on the user library, but they wouldnt be connected just because they share the same type

The type(tag) is still very useful when we want to filter for, search and compare things that arent directly related.

系統支持輸入`#tag` 形同標記`[[#tag]]` （就像支持`＠`形同`[[]]`一樣），這張`[[#tag]]` 統一在`Tags`的白板內。
如果雙鏈時沒有這張`[[#tag]]`卡片，就在`Tags` 中新建一張`[[#tag]]`卡片。然後也提供一個現在的Tags Viewer功能。
至於其他關於inline tag 能不能寫內容，或是可不可以connection的問題，確實是設計上引導使用者建立習慣的方式，這個還是尊重開發者的設計理念。

"**Vertical Scrolling Journal Timeline**
I love the journal and timeline view for the card library- but i miss the scrolling of timeline in the journal.
Ive been taking journal notes in logseq, that work pretty much like the timeline view in hepta, and the difference for me is light and day- it makes much easier to look back on the past journal entries or even see at a glance what was the last(previous) journal entry

Dont get me wrong, im not talking about bringing the timeline back where the journal is- having then separate is the most important part, a no-whiteboard zone to just type right away

In the current view (locked to 1 journal) if my last journal entry was more then 6 days ago i wouldnt see a cue to it for example, only by clicking in the calendar.
Also looking for a specific thing written in a journal entry- without a clear idea witch day- means clicking on the calendar and then each day, then on the calendar again and so on...

My sugestions:
*A) bellow current day scrolling*
At the bottom of the journal page showing the previous journal (that was filled in), making journal also works as a timeline view (of the journal only) just by scrolling
*B) A previously button/toggle on the botton*
Once clicked it expands the previous entries for scrolling
*C) Timeline button (top-right)*
For consistency, using the same button and icon for the timeline view in the card library",2022-06-25 21:43:00.144000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],990371560110043176,[]

3. If card names, tags and whiteboard links all functioned as basically tags, and could be filtered by references to these in any combination, that would allow for greater cross-whiteboard connections and remove the brain damage of trying to figure out whether you want to create a card, a tag or refer to another whiteboard when trying to connect ideas.

"我不確定Heptabase希望使用者直接在白板編輯卡片或是把所有要編輯的卡片選取後Open in new tab，但是希望至少提升其中一種體驗。

"Would it be possible to have a feature similar to the sync blocks in other apps in the market? The flow I am trying to achieve is,

I am trying to use the timeline view as a daily planner. I have projects in whiteboards with cards holding the notes/data/information and also tasks to be done in the project. I copy paste the tasks into my daily planner so I don't have to navigate to different boards and see my pending tasks. I will not be able to sync the status of those tasks if I just copy and paste.

With something like sync blocks, I can imaging embedding card content or blocks into a card from the timeline and they all share the status of the content. This way planning is just linking appropriate blocks of text. Does this make sense? You can ignore this, if there is a feature down the road for task management as that would be a more appropriate solution.",2022-06-01 14:26:45.747000+00:00,sundar,,[],[],981564467957624832,[]

"Hello hepta team, 
It would be really helpful to be able to jump to the card **within the whiteboard** where it's located from the global search window. Using ctrl/cmd+enter or something. I know it could be challenging UI-wise because the card could exist in multiple whiteboards. Maybe a dropdown with available whiteboards would appear. I think this feature would dramatically improve the navigation experience.

"**FR: Going directly to card from map/board views**

"Please don't change the behavior such that typing '/' while writing automatically opens the block selection list. I’m fine with this being the default behavior at the beginning of a block, however. This is one of my biggest issues with apps like Notion, Logseq, and Anytype. I use the slash character quite frequently in my own writing, and seeing an irrelevant menu pop up constantly is pretty distracting. The current solution works well enough, but it’s not perfect. It would be better if we kept the current ‘ctrl + /’ activation , along with allowing the user to save their position in the block they were editing. Under the current paradigm, the entire block is selected. While the user may easily navigate to the end of the block by pressing Enter, not every scenario is best served by imposing this one-size-fits-all solution.

"Hi, I just joined Hepta and have to say that I'm loving the product.

I'm a 3d artist and as part of my workflow I use a ""Mood Board"" where I capture tweets from other 3d artists. It would be nice to be able to paste a twitter link into a Card, and have the tweet be auto embedded. Right now I'm having to screenshot the tweet and add a link to the tweet manually. It works ok, but it does break away the process a little. This is something I really liked when using Roam, that I could just copy/paste a tweet and it would auto embed.

As an additional thought, some tweets come with video content, and it would be so helpful if the playable content was also playable on Hepta.

I searched the server and didn't see this being suggested so posting here. I saw video embedding is already being considered which is awesome! Thanks for all the work, this is a great product!",2022-04-15 16:15:45.714000+00:00,0xdede,,[],[],964559668884172850,[]

Tags are scaffolds that are really only useful when you need and can apply sorting, filtering etc to them, and when the number of objects are bigger. It’s not very useful, counterproductive even, on its own. Of course when you do have a lot of objects, you run into other problems that only AI can solve, but that’s a different topic.

"Feature Request:

It would be nice if Heptabase would preserve the spacing in any given card.

Background:

While working in a whiteboard, oftentimes I’ll find myself adding spaces (empty blocks) between text blocks to indicate to myself that I either want to input content there later or to just help me think. Most of the time, though, it just serves a a reminder that I’m going to write something in that area. I certainly could add some placeholder text to be deleted later, but that’s just inconvenient for me. The same applies for when I’m working full screen on a note, writing prose. When I return to a note, it’s mildly bothersome (to say the least) to find that any spaces I had left between blocks, at the beginning or end of the document, have now disappeared.",2022-03-29 21:16:55.436000+00:00,prixsen,,[],[],958474865076240394,[]

Then some experiments I would like to try out:
- **Snap to grid ** - auto-arrange cards by fitting them on a common grid (round to next multiple for x/y coorditanes and width/height)
- **Lists** - Cards are auto-arranged in a list under each other, potentially a 'container' card acts as the boundary for the list, you can drag other cards inside this boundary and they will be added to the list.
    - **Accordion** - Special mode of the list where the cards are collapsed and you can open one at a time (for this the event handler would need to know the 'previous state' as well, so that I can determine which card was opened and close all others)
    - **Queue** - A special list where the first and last element are expanded and the other ones are collapsed (could be nice for organizing/prioritizing your work/todo list)",2022-03-28 17:40:55.384000+00:00,dennkster,,[],[],958058118812696686,[]

""@todo-tracker""and within the todo-tracker card, i copy and paste the to-do list and append the backlink to where it originated from. Each time i cross a list, i'll click on the backlink and strike it out from that page as well. Its tedious, but at least i have some control of the list.

"As much as I would think it fits Hepta vision to have an app (just like Timeline, Tags, Map, and Cards Library) that manage tasks stored in various cards, this is clearly not on Hepta's short-term roadmap [1]. My workaround is to just don't even try to do any task management in Hepta at all (this adds friction as most note-taking tools have task and knowledge management close and supports various date-related operations like reminders, date pickers etc), but I'm adding several people who had asked about task management and see if they have come up ways of using Hepta for task management.

"Obviously it's not my call to make feature prioritization. I was hoping to hear more direct answer though. All features have values for some users if not all users, and that's where prioritization comes in. Delete all would matter for some but surely less so for others. My read is that Heptabase is not interested in switching existing users from existing note-taking tools Roam, Obsidian, logseq, and that probably explains why we still see large gaps in Wikilinks, tags, and table stakes like delete notes. On the other hand, whiteboard features and performance get more love, probably to create differentiation and not get too much behind similar whiteboards Kosmik and Scrintal.

I love the ability to collapse bullet points by clicking on the bullet. 🙌

However, I'd also love the ability to click ""into"" the bullet point to focus on that set of bullet points (similar to how Logseq and Roam Research do it).

In order to facilitate this, you could add a simple ""toggle"" icon when there are already a series of bullet points. If there is only one bullet point, then clicking on it would take you ""into"" that bullet point so you could add more. 

Again, just like how Logseq and Roam do it. 

Finally, it would be awesome if we could also `Opt-Click` on a bullet point to open that set of bullet points in the sidebar, to work on editing them further there.",2022-03-10 20:19:43.054000+00:00,crsmoore,,[],[],951575099176271914,[]

"**+Bonus: Extruse bullet point/block as card (on boards)**
Similar to how some apps allow for block reference/link or embeds, but as cards on the boards.

The idea could be very simple to use (for the users, front end): simply dragging a block from a card into the board... and then a new card would appear on the board of just that block *with some color, shape and other denotations that its a diferent type of card*

Extruded/Transcluded blocks (ideas)
- dont exist as files/notes on library, just as cards on boards. Dropping any number of blocks into a board would add 0 new notes on the library
- they render/sync with the note they were extruded from. Editing the content on such a block-card would change that block in the main note and vice-versa
- red/dotted/special line: when clicking/focusing on a extruded block it would show a a special/different line from it to the its source note (If said note is on the board) 
-- only show on focus
-- clicking on the line jumps/moves the board to the main note as focus
-- *chooses the closest source note on board, if any is on board:* in case the user have multiple instances of the parent note to a block-card, said line would be drawn to the closes one only
-- *i tought a noticeable thiner and bright line would work best* thiner subtly informing its a sort of link that is not permanent like user draw lines",2022-03-07 10:45:02.814000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],950343314970931250,[]

"** use case to justify my feature request of ""Auto-fit""**

Here's my actual use case **to explain why I expect the feature ""Auto-fit"" will save me time**. It is not project management, I took these notes when I read something, which could be books, papers, or web articles.

There are 21 cards involved, grouped into 11 blocks, labeled as 1, 2, ..., 11 in the diagram. In each block, I may have several cards glued together vertically. The cards in purple mean that they are not finished, or need further clarifications or corrections. 

I had four independent reading activities at different moments. On Monday, I read something and created (1,2); On Tuesday, I wrote (3,4,5,6,7),  Wednesday (8), and Thursday (9,10,11).

Take the example of how I arranged the cards in (3,4,5,6,7). I created two cards for two parallel ideas so I put them together vertically, so I got block 3. There are some ideas to explain cards in block 3, so I created cards 4,5,6 and attached them to cards in (3) horizontally. Furthermore, I created block (7) which includes two cards, to explain card 5. (Before attaching block 7, I adjust the width of card 5.) 

That's how I created all these cards. Now I found that the card in (7) answers a question raised in a card in block 2, so I connect them. Totally, I have four connections, all of which are for question-answer relations.

In this use case, I spent <10% time moving the cards or creating connections. I create a card and attach it to other cards vertically or horizontally. I spent the most time adjusting the height of the cards and keeping cards glued together. Then I expect **a feature of ""Auto-fit""** will do the most job for me.",2022-02-20 01:29:03.084000+00:00,catphys,<MessageReference message_id=943520236974534677 channel_id=856016076311101470 guild_id=812292969183969301>,[],[],944767576137953280,[<Attachment id=944767575500390410 filename='unknown.png' url='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856016076311101470/944767575500390410/unknown.png'>]

Now that we have tags on the infopanel (love it!) i used then in such a small window and i couldnt close the info panel- reason being it only closes on clicking outside, and there was no outside in such a small window (but i loved how the infopanel looked 'fullscreen' in a tiny window)
I intuively went for the escape key to close but no-go
***2 Open Card Info***
a hotkey to open the info panel while were typing (without the need to lift the hand from the keyboard)

***3 Tag Shortcut***
like something as simple as typing T when a infopanel is open, 'cliking'/starting a new tag

"I'm just going to create this message and edit it if I think of any other stuff

- Allow dragging and dropping of files either into an existing open note, or into empty space to create a new note with the doc

- Not sure if docs are stored as DB globs, but a local storage mode to allow self-service VC and sync like Obsidian would be nice

- Change `New Whiteboard` action on the map page to only be invoked on double click, like the new card behaviour on board page.

- Do not preserve cards that are empty, such as from a double click

- Whiteboard and Map zoom to fit (and maybe miro style minimap)

- ""Immersive"" editor shamelessly stolen from Obsidian that shows full unrendered MD on the currently active line

- Temporarily note editing modals (maybe on single click). This would be really useful in the map view to be able to click note titles to see and edit their content without entering into the whole board.

- This is a very ambitious one, but allow boards within boards and then make the Map a board itself as an immutable ""root board""

"I use duplicate cards on the same board quite often.

...and both dealing with many of the same cards

Some other uses
-alternatives/proposals: like a side by side columm or row of how to order something, with alternatives side by side
Say if it were book chapters each 'alternative' would draw the same chapter/content cards but each in a different order
-folded vs unfolded
Im getting used to listing a bunch of cards in folded state in one are of the board, while in another area the same cards are unfolded with relational arrows draw
-Media
A reference image being next to what it would be useful, that same reference as a card avoids pasting the same image on a bunch of cards.
I also like the idea of using images as a sort of landmark to browse a larger map- the same card with a big warning image would be easy to spot in the 3 areas it was put, next to something theyre warning about

I also often do duplicates temporarily- few of my boards are 'static', most are more like sketches.

"Imagine you:

3. Then go to `Map`

If you click backward multiple times, I guess I would expect to go back step 7 to 1 passing trough all steps. 

I see it's not as simple as in chrome, because in chrome it's just pages, and you're simply moving back and forward. In Hepta you're like in different contexts (Timeline, Map, Whiteboard, Card in Split Screen, Card in Full Screen), and going backwards I would expect to jump between all these contexts. 

Other example: 
1. You're in `Whiteboard A`
2. open card `Y` in split screen
3. open card `Y` in full screen

If I click `back`, first I would expect to switch from full screen to split screen, if I click `back` again, then I wold expect that the split screen disapears and you can only see `Whiteboard A`

"I know the idea of nested boards has been brought up numerous times, and I _think_ I have an idea that might allow for something similar based on my recent whiteboards, with two possible implementations.

**Motivation/Pain point:** Boards involving complex topics are becoming more common, and some could use some strong interlinking. However, a full reference to the card could be distracting from the active board's content and, while related, may not be _relevant_ to that particular discussion; that is, having the linked card on another board may detract from the content, as I'm starting to feel. The boards I've been working on are all highly related, yet contain discrete topics that don't overlap much; having a way to navigate through my boards _without_ creating copies of the relevant cards would be **incredibly** helpful.

**Solution #1: ""Ghost"" Cards**
Effectively, these cards act as simple pointers to a card on another board; it would display nothing but the card title and target whiteboard, possibly using the card's color for both outline and text, with the board's default background color for its background (or transparent) to quickly identify it. Double-clicking on it would then jump to the whiteboard and navigate to the card as though the user has first navigated to the whiteboard and then clicked on a link to the card.

**Solution #2: Card Link Change**
Another option would be to allow existing card links to navigate to other boards; I imagine it being part of a context menu for the links that allows you to jump to existing instances on other boards. The result of following this mode of navigation would be identical to Solution #1.",2022-01-22 14:51:16.635000+00:00,Curio Heart,,[],[],934460214781018162,[]

"Great product, I'm impressed at how polished the whiteboard feels.

Would it be possible to more quickly ""extract"" chunks of content into a new card?

Use case:

- I'm writing a card, it's getting large
- I realize that one part is starting to go off on a tangent, and probably deserves to be it's own card

What I currently do:

- Double click to create a new card
- Cut the contents of the part I want to ""extract"" into the new card
- Go back to the original card and ""@-link"" the card I just created

What would be nice:

- Highlight the content I want to turn into a new card
- Hit some keyboard shortcut, command, or something in a menu
- The content is replaced by a link to a newly created page

I'm imagining something like Notion's *""Turn into Page""*, or *""Extract variable/method""* in an IDE",2022-01-19 07:44:16.148000+00:00,tntmarket,,[],[],933265591073116161,[]

"**Tags v2 additions**
Im so happy tags are back! Just a few ideas on what i felt missing:
**Adding tags on Board  & Library Views**
Probably already planned. I find tags most useful when they can be applied as soon as cards are created or while theyre being edited, and that happens a lot in board view and in the library view too. 
**Show Boards a note is in (in tag tab)**
Just like the popup saying 'this card is in x baords' that appear in board view, i think showing the same when a card is selected in tag-view would be great.
That way we could go to tags for overview and filtering and then choosing one to see in what contexts its in. Like in boardview the 'this card is in x boards' allowing to jump straight to a board with the card in focus
**Expanded View(in tags tab)**
An option to open a note in large full-screen view from the tags view
**Renaming Tags**
An option to rename tags. I thing that would work best from the tags-tab/view- as each tag is selected it shows the tag as a title on top of the list on the current build.

"I want to share my current framework on MIRO board and some ideas that rhyme with hepta. First thing when I saw hepta, I told myself that this is what I really need. Canvas to work with the text, toy with ideas, link them and arrange as I develop my ideas, and work with manuscript. 

Before hepta in my constant rotation I had obsidian to work with text and thoughts (and I still use it occasionally), but first work with ideas had been done one MIRO board. I toy with ideas with materials that I might need, and because MIRO is extremely good in visualizing, using mindmaps, sticky notes, blocks, text and drawing tools. It have been doing work splendidly. In hepta I thought information could be organized into something similar. You can look at my current MIRO board, where I arrange things for lectures, there I usually put videos, pictures, sometimes docs (pdf), later after lecture is delivered content from MIRO is systematized in OBSIDIAN (now in hepta).

So my question is, can embeded video from youtube be added on whiteboard? Pictures? Audio files? Whole PDF docs?

"FR: Projects/Spaces
Between personal knowledge, planing, amateur writing, breaking down a project or planing and even planing a tabletop rpg session... the many uses/areas/subjects i want and im starting using hepta for dont really overlap.
Separating boards and clustering borders apart on the map works, but i also wanted to do quick notes directly on the timeline and use the timeline +NoWhiteboard on the library as a way to mark and find what were quick-and-dirty notes vs the notes organized in boards... by wich point they all become mushed together, i mean, the different unrelated areas a note pertains to.

Also i often write notes that have similar titles and first lines, even tough theyre from highly different areas- and that makes searching messy when im working on one thing, i rather not have results pertaining to what i dont need right now showing up in search

Tags +filtering options (in search, library, etc) could cover that- but in the abscence of tags...

The idea:
Similar to Notion's workspaces, Onenotes notebooks or Obsidian's vaults- a way to separate areas, be it inside the same library or 'entirely'
They could be called spaces, areas or- Given the name Heptabase... bases? just an idea
Anyway switching bases could be/feel like switching libraries entirely.
It would probably make sense if they were actually different libraries, but from a users perspective it would only matter how they`re set in the frontend (and backing up options, like exporting a json with all bases/areas or individually, both options).

Btw exporting bases/areas individually would be great for cooperative work, a company sharing wikis or even the community sharing stuff (like it happens over at obsidian, the most famous one being the Lyt Kit). Thats also how Eagle works too wich i found very useful for sharing and space management- and while hepta probably wont be a disk space hog for most users, as it expands and local images are added and over time...",2021-11-27 21:33:50.115000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],914267801345200169,[]

Re-arranging some boards and deciding to use cards into others, i had to remenber wich cards interested me from one board to ad to the other, then using the sidebar scroll or remenber the titles of each, or just go reading until i found the right ones...

I just realized it would be much more practical in such cases to right click on a card and choose a ""add to another whiteboard""
Upon clicking the list of boards would show up, and clicking on any would add the card there

+Inbox/Incoming
Whenever a card is added/sent to an whiteboard without it opened, a bottom bar called inbox or incoming would show up on the whiteboard.
It could be like the sidebar import only horizontal, or vertical but on the left (to make it distinct)

Ps: i can see many cases where cards could/would be added on a whiteboard without it opened
considering current practical uses and future ones:
-drag and droping from the library straight into a whiteboard on the sidebar
-from one whiteboard already opened(as described above)
-from a co-worker/extra seats/users (future, if/when theres colaboration)
-from a share-to/grab on mobile or even chrome/browser extensions in the desktop

"FR: So let's say someone is using Meta heavily for scheduling and actions that are _date-driven_. Typically, these kinds of cards _expire because the event is now in the past_. It would be nice to set an expiration date for a card, so on that date the card pops up and promps the user to delete or extend the expiration date.  **This might also be approached as a** _reminder card_.
This would solve the following problem: accumulating out-of-date cards and not having to search and clean them out manually and/or a way to be _reminded to do something with that card_.",2021-10-08 19:25:47.221000+00:00,Sams_Here,,[],[],896116183672184844,[]

**Better Help(shortcuts+)**
Ive experienced a bug or just some misunderstanding of metas shortcuts (as i explained in a bug report)
Regardless of the bug(or even being a bug) thing is i couldnt double-check if it was some mistyped shortcut since i couldnt check what were all the shortcuts.

My first instinct was clicking on the question mark/help button- but that only replays the tutorial

My sugestion: *Turning the help button into a more general overview of shortcuts and behaviours* - including the replay tutorial as one of the options on it.

The best way(i think) would be the help to open a sidebar similar to the split view, showing a document of sorts (preferably with a gray background, so its not mistaken by how cards look- ui colored), with links and or folded bullet-points, listing every useful topic on behaviour, use and shortcuts- from double clicking a card in split view to expanded view (just released feature) to everything else- anything that can be done with mouse, clicks and typing that isnt obvious on the interface should be there

This same help document could/should have a 'replay tutorial' button on the top, just moving the current replay feature to inside the help.

I know filling documentation like that eats time (even more so on such a fast paced build push, love agile iteration) but i imagine having a overview of all commands and interactions like that is needed anyway during development, probably in a table- so the help could be written in such a way that its basically the same table devs refer to for already stabilished commands/interactions.",2021-09-12 15:03:24.210000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],886628068192571393,[]

**SPACES(libraries)**👈🙏
Problem: meta automatically saves data via browser without handling things like a ""library"" file.
That works fine, but for people wanting to use meta for different uses- different subjects, life vs work, whatever- they have to put everything in the same meta library
-mentioning cards way more then wanted may appear that would never matter for a boards particular subject
-scrolling through the card library or graph gets increasingly noiser as cards and boards grow- if they do so on multiple areas with no overlap they get in the way
**solution: spaces/libraries**
Like Notion and Miro have spaces or Obsidian have library files...
A space/library working just like it is, but creating new ones and switching showing different card libraries and boards, without one appearing on the others
-from a code and backedn perspective it could still be the same single library- instead spaces would work as top level folder/filters that ""pretend"" each exists alone",2021-09-09 15:29:01.325000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],885547351723372594,[]

**Paste Images Directly**
I love using images for reference, and in some cases images overlaping one another (more useful to have then slighty overlaping taking less space)
As it is i paste images into cards just fine, but resizing (new feature, loving it) is wonky (theyre resized separatedly from the card theyre in), and in cases where i only want the image theres always the card border around
**Request:**
Pasting an image (image on the clipboard) when in a board, without any card in focus, pasting the image as its own card container
-on Card Library the image would count as 1 card
-title: filename(if possible), but even automatic names or ids are fine (ex: img1, img2)
-resizing the image like cards",2021-09-09 15:21:44.560000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],885545519798173716,[]

**Sticky Card Scrolling**
*my memory may fail me, but i think meta used to behave like this request*
Whenever content is bigger then a cards size on the board a scroll bar appears that allows scrolling through it all(wich is great)
**problem/usecase**
Clicking outside of a card springs the cards content back to the top.
-i often want to read one thing while im writing another, i can do that in meta but if the reference is a long text i have to rearrange the board/resize a card so i can operate on another card and still see the content i want
-i have inserted cards into other boards because of one part of said card thats relevant; In longer cards i end up loosing context as to why ive put that card in that place (i wish i could scroll to the relevant part and leave it there)
The alternative would be creating cards with excerpts of other cards... but that would mean more work and multiplying cards with redundant content (already in other cards)
**simple solution:**
having meta remenber scrolled cards position (the scroll showing even with the card out of focus, to show visually its scrolled down)
**better solution**
Remenber scroll position like above, but also showing the cards title(first line) as a bar on the top as soon as a scrolled card leaves focus",2021-09-09 15:15:14.115000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],885543882153156629,[]

"Feature Request:
MAP VIEW IS AMAZING. Its one of the things i wanted most!

But one of the main reasons i wanted it was for making that sort of view/nesting per board.
A map view for tags globally is awesome, but big and complex boards could become extremely easier to navigate, visualize the big picture vs smaller things and overall more powerfull if they could do something similar.

I think nesting cards onto another (on a per board basis, not globally) would be the best solution- appearing just like map view.
Nesting like that btw would also achieve the kanban, another planed feature.

Also, coupled with board shortcuts to other boards, users would be able to nest and navigate fully via the board through the relationships amongst multiple boards pertaining to one another (for my usecase, pertaining the same project)
+it would in essence turn meta closer to a notion alternative for anyone who likes to make their own navigation, even better for that as a powerful dashboard+map since all cards are transcluded",2021-07-16 15:04:39.368000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],865609887223382026,[]

I can implement 2,3,5 in the upcoming week.

4 is more of a design challenge, there are some complexity in it that may require implementing an ""option window"", which I need to discuss with <@!812311644457795635> on how the interface should look like. For example, if a card is **red** in whiteboard-1 and **blue** in whiteboard-2, and I import to whiteboard-3, then the user has to determine which color to use.

1 is on the roadmap, but the complexity is pretty high and I need to do a bit more research before implementing it.

I think there would be times when I would want to be able to *delete all instances* without chasing down every time a card was mentioned. Its the entire benefit of bidirectional so I am doing less jumping around

However, there would be times when we might want to delete in bulk contents on a given whiteboard without it being pushed to all whiteboards. Need to explore some options here as I have not thought this out so far. Some apps use wiki links so the collection point is easier to see & therefore approach from this perspective but whiteboards might lose that

The bulk items that I have seen here (such as adding tags in bulk, deleting in bulk, etc) seem to be limited to the *all cards* view. See link above where this convo began  😉

I would like to also have the option to be able to do this from a given *whiteboard* as well. The reasoning for this is that over time I see that the *all cards* could have quite a bit of content added to them & as a result will become over whelming & not so productive.

"Hi <@!779015270311395370> , thanks for the response. I think I will elaborate. So my problem is that sometimes I just want to write the tile of something, without having content in it. However, if I fold the card, I have to unfold it to draw the lines. My user journey to creating a title card right now: Create a new card -> make it smaller so that it is only 1-line long (takes like 1-2 secs because the arrow to make the card smaller is quite hard to find) -> write the title -> drag the arrow. If I use the folding option, then my user journey is: create a new card -> fold it -> make other cards -> then realize I need to draw arrow -> unfold title card -> draw the arrow(s) -> refold it. The unfold - refold takes some time if I constantly add more content cards and need to draw arrows. I am the type of person who has to see the arrow immediately, not the one who writes all the content cards and draws the arrows.",2021-07-05 06:33:26.061000+00:00,Thu Dang,,[],[<User id=779015270311395370 name='Alan Chan' discriminator='3179' bot=False>],861494967528456204,[]

Speaking of ux now- since the metaeditor isnt in yet and most of us got attracted by metas main distinct feature (the whiteboards), im pretty much just editing notes in the whiteboards directly- most of the time i forget to expand, and when i do i forget theres the markdown choice 🤦‍♂️",2021-06-21 00:09:36.183000+00:00,Vincer,<MessageReference message_id=856323825427808286 channel_id=856016076311101470 guild_id=812292969183969301>,[],[<User id=779015270311395370 name='Alan Chan' discriminator='3179' bot=False>],856324943100379146,[]

"🔥 **Linking Options**
*i know internal links are in the works and will come with metaeditor*
But i would LOVE to see better linking options, for external links
1) *rename*
pasting a link prompting and or allowing to rename its alias

2) *uri* links 👈
(i think thats what theyre called)- the links that tell the os to open a file/path with a given application...
Ever since i discovered then ive been using then whenever i can, like linking to onenote pages in obsidian and vice-versa
For us using multiple apps its the only way to bridge (to an extent) the gap between tools
im hyped for metaeditor (only thing missing for me to heavily take notes in meta) but it will handle the hyperlinking magic within meta
I just need that bridge, that portal, so i can more easily jump through things... id rather be ideating and linking in meta, writing longform and outlining in obisidian
now that i just embeded meta inside obsidian... *this just became my most imediate wish*

3) Meta Links!!
The other way around- i was surprised when i found out notes didnt had a url link on the adress bar
it makes sense the way the app works, but then we'd need some way to generate links- to open/go-to Meta and open a specific note (also whiteboards)
*i understand at this point it would only work when opened on a browser with cached metanotes in it*",2021-06-20 23:29:46.287000+00:00,Vincer,,[],[],856314919149109278,[]

"**Type Tool**
A button somewhere on the board with a letter symbol (T for example)
-Clicking on it changes the cursor to show a letter
-Clicking on a empty space would create a semi-transparent/dashed rectangle for tiping inside
-clicking away, selecting something else etc would hide the texts border
For typing outside cards as auxiliary text on whiteboards.
Additional text have no need to be listed globally, non taggable etc- just existing per whiteboard
-Clicking on it showing the outside rectangle again, for resizing its area (affecting line and word breaks, like it works on cards)

2) duplication via drag
notes can already be imported in multiple instances
with some hotkey (ctrl, shift, etc) pressed down, selecting then dragging a note creating a duplicate instead
(the user would then be dragging the newly made copy)
+keep the imported notes(via import) as unstyled (default style assigned to the card globally, if in the future that becomes a thing)
