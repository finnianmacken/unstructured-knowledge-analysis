It’s not very useful, counterproductive even, on its own. Of course when you do have a lot of objects, you run into other problems that only AI can solve, but that’s a different topic.

Each time i cross a list, i'll click on the backlink and strike it out from that page as well. Its tedious, but at least i have some control of the list.

My read is that Heptabase is not interested in switching existing users from existing note-taking tools Roam, Obsidian, logseq, and that probably explains why we still see large gaps in Wikilinks, tags, and table stakes like delete notes. On the other hand, whiteboard features and performance get more love, probably to create differentiation and not get too much behind similar whiteboards Kosmik and Scrintal.

      "\u001b[91m[1721] No match found for: (UPDATE: I searched \"nested\" in the forum and see that we will have to wait a little bit to see whether nested whiteboards will be implemented in some fashion. I am soooooo hoping that it is.) Just started using Heptabase today. REALLY liking it. It appears that <@!368602215474266113> 's post above is probably related to my question, which it sounds like has been asked often: will Heptabase eventually give us the option of creating maps within maps (or boards within boards—or nested boards)? I didn't see anything about this on the roadmap—hence my question. The annotated screenshot below shows what I'm hoping I will eventually be able to do in Heptabase.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[91m[1722] No match found for: I know the idea of nested boards has been brought up numerous times, and I think I have an idea that might allow for something similar based on my recent whiteboards, with two possible implementations.\n",
      "Motivation/Pain point: Boards involving complex topics are becoming more common, and some could use some strong interlinking. However, a full reference to the card could be distracting from the active board's content and, while related, may not be relevant to that particular discussion; that is, having the linked card on another board may detract from the content, as I'm starting to feel. The boards I've been working on are all highly related, yet contain discrete topics that don't overlap much; having a way to navigate through my boards without creating copies of the relevant cards would be incredibly helpful.\n",
      "Solution #1: \"Ghost\" Cards\n",
      "Effectively, these cards act as simple pointers to a card on another board; it would display nothing but the card title and target whiteboard, possibly using the card's color for both outline and text, with the board's default background color for its background (or transparent) to quickly identify it. Double-clicking on it would then jump to the whiteboard and navigate to the card as though the user has first navigated to the whiteboard and then clicked on a link to the card.\n",
      "Solution #2: Card Link Change\n",
      "Another option would be to allow existing card links to navigate to other boards; I imagine it being part of a context menu for the links that allows you to jump to existing instances on other boards. The result of following this mode of navigation would be identical to Solution #1.\u001b[0m\n",
